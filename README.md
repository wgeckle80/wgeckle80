## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Wyatt, and I'm a senior at the University of Maryland
studying Computer Engineering and Mathematics. Currently, my main interests lie
in cybersecurityâ€”particularly in relation to embedded systems, operating
systems, and networking.

[My blog](https://wgeckle80.github.io/blog/) is the primary source of what I'm
currently working on. I have recently finished the Google Summer of Code
project
[Port FreeBSD to QEMU microvm](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2025Projects/PortFreeBSDToQEMUMicrovm).
I'm also the Webmaster of the Maryland Beta Chapter of
[Tau Beta Pi](https://www.tbp.org/), where I operate our website located at
<https://www.tbpmdbeta.org/>.

Feel free to contact me by email at <wgeckle80@gmail.com>!
