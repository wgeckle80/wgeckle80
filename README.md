## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Wyatt, and I'm a rising senior at the University of Maryland
studying Computer Engineering and Mathematics. Currently, my main interests lie
in cybersecurityâ€”particularly in relation to embedded systems, operating
systems, and networking.

[My blog](https://wgeckle80.github.io/blog/) is the primary source of what I'm
currently working on. Right now, the two major projects I have are the Google
Summer of Code project
[Port FreeBSD to QEMU microvm](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2025Projects/PortFreeBSDToQEMUMicrovm),
and a home network upgrade. I also currently maintain the Maryland Beta chapter
[website](https://www.tbpmdbeta.org/) of [Tau Beta Pi](https://www.tbp.org/).

Feel free to contact me by email at <wgeckle80@gmail.com>!
